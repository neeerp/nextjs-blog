## Currently Reading

I'm actively reading the following books still. As of writing this, I just
started 'Team Topologies', however I like to switch up what I'm currently
reading sometimes and have the others on the back-burner.

## Paused

These are books that I started reading but didn't quite finish. I've gotten
these to varying degrees of done (some of which I might have a single chapter or
two remaining, while others I may have >50% the book remaining).

I plan on coming back to some of them, while others might be a bit too dry for
my liking (_cough_ Code Complete) or were only read for specific reference.
